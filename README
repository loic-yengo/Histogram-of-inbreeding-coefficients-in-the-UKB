This table shows the histogram of 3 inbreeding measures in 456,414 participants of the UK Biobank (UKB) of European ancestry.
The 3 inbreeding measures are denotes Funi (correlation between uniting gametes, Yang et al. 2011; AJHG), Fhom, the classical
excess of homozygosity measure and Froh, defined as the percentage of the genome covered by >1.5Mb long runs of homozygosity (ROH).

These summary statistics where derived from genotype data of UKB participants obtained under project 12505. No phenotype is provided here.
UKB data can be accessed upon request once a research project has been submitted and approved by the
UKB committee.
